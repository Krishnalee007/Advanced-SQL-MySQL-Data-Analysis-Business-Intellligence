Question 01) Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions 
and orders so that we can showcase the growth there? 

Question 02) Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and 
brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.

Question 03) While we’re on Gsearch, could you dive into nonbrand, and pull monthly sessions and orders split by device 3 type? I want to flex our analytical muscles a little and show the board we really know our traffic sources.

Question 04) I’m worried that one of our more pessimistic board members may be concerned about the large % of traffic from 4 Gsearch. Can you pull monthly trends for Gsearch, alongside monthly trends for each of our other channels

Question 05) d like to tell the story of our website performance improvements over the course of the first 8 months. 5 Could you pull session to order conversion rates, by month

Question 06) For the gsearch lander test, please estimate the revenue that test earned us (Hint: Look at the increase in CVR 
from the test (Jun 19 – Jul 28), and use nonbrand sessions and revenue since then to calculate incremental value)

Question 07) For the landing page test you analyzed previously, it would be great to show a full conversion funnel from each 
of the two pages to orders. You can use the same time period you analyzed last time (Jun 19 – Jul 28).

Question 08) I’d love for you to quantify the impact of our billing test, as well. Please analyze the lift generated from the test 
(Sep 10 – Nov 10), in terms of revenue per billing page session, and then pull the number of billing page sessions 
for the past month to understand monthly impact.
