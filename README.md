Question 01) Gsearch seems to be the biggest driver of our business. Could you pull monthly trends for gsearch sessions 
and orders so that we can showcase the growth there? 

Question 02) Next, it would be great to see a similar monthly trend for Gsearch, but this time splitting out nonbrand and 
brand campaigns separately. I am wondering if brand is picking up at all. If so, this is a good story to tell.
